# Project Name: EchoFrame
Tagline
"Ask the video. Hear its echo."
Overview
EchoFrame is a memory-augmented reasoning system that allows users to upload short videos and interact with them via natural language — asking deep, contextual questions about what happened. It combines Gemini (for video understanding) and LLaMA 4 (for long-context, multilingual and reasoning capabilities).
Users can receive dynamic summaries, podcasts, or interactive videos using Tavus, and interact through a responsive UI that supports both text and audio-based queries.
Problem Statement Fit
Aligned With:
Statement 1: Long Context Applications


Statement 2: Native Multimodality


Why It Fits
Uses Gemini or Whisper to extract structured text and transcripts from videos.


Generates summaries of each video.


Passes summaries and full transcripts into LLaMA 4 for deep reasoning and language generation.


Outputs podcast-style narratives, multilingual outputs, and even Tavus-generated interactive video responses.


Users can interact with results through a UI supporting attachments and audio inputs.


Use Case: "Ask the Heist" – Security Camera Scenario
Scenario: A 1–2 minute simulated surveillance video shows:
A man in a red hoodie enters a room and places a backpack on the table.


Moments later, a woman enters and sits at the table.


The man closes a laptop and walks out, leaving the backpack.


The woman glances around, quietly takes the bag, and exits.


Purpose: The scenario is packed with subtle visual and temporal cues that test long-context understanding and memory-based reasoning.
Demo Flow:
Upload the "Heist" video.


Gemini or Whisper extracts:


Detailed event timeline:

 [00:00] Man in red hoodie enters the room.
[00:05] He places a black backpack on the table.
[00:12] Woman enters and sits down.
[00:18] Man closes the laptop.
[00:25] Man leaves the room.
[00:30] Woman takes the backpack and leaves.


Summaries of the video


LLaMA 4 processes the full context and answers:


"Who took the backpack?"


"Was the laptop used or touched?"


"What is suspicious in this sequence of actions?"


"Did the woman interact with the man before he left?"


Output includes:


Summarized podcast of the event


Tavus-generated interactive explanation video


Multilingual responses for accessibility


Display results in the UI with spoken/audio responses and text interaction bar.

Long-Term Impact
Security: Analyze surveillance with memory-like accuracy


Education: Convert experiments and lectures to podcasts/videos


Accessibility: Interactive, spoken responses for vision/language-impaired users


Media: Summarize or analyze shows, episodes, events with full recall


Why This Wins
Combines Gemini’s perception with LLaMA’s reasoning and long memory


Produces structured, multilingual, and interactive outputs


Enables conversational interaction with video-derived knowledge


Demonstrates the future of media: not passive, but queryable and intelligent


Demo Script (Optional)
“This is a short surveillance-style video where two people enter a room.”


“Gemini parses what happened — but LLaMA is the memory that reasons about it.”


Ask:


“Who interacted with the laptop?”


“Was the backpack taken by the same person who brought it?”


“What happened between 00:10 and 00:30?”


Show the podcast and Tavus video explaining the full sequence.


Conclude: “EchoFrame lets you talk to the past — with full memory, logic, and clarity.”


Fallback Demo Option:
“Instead of surveillance, we uploaded three workshop recordings.”
“EchoFrame extracted full content and created multilingual podcast summaries and a video instructor.”
Ask:
“Which speaker explained the core concept best?”
“What examples did Session 2 use?”
Conclude: “EchoFrame becomes your personal learning companion.”
