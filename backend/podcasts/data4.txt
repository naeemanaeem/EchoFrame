Welcome to Donsky Tech. Today, we're going to explore how to interface with a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor using your Raspberry Pi. We'll be using Python as our programming language.

First, let's take a look at the hardware we'll be using. We have the DHT22 sensor module, a Raspberry Pi0W, a breakout board, and some connecting wires. The DHT22 module already has a pull-up resistor and filter capacitor, so we don't need to connect any external components.

The DHT22 module outputs temperature and humidity through a single data line, and it only has three pins: power, ground, and data. To connect it to our Raspberry Pi, we simply need to wire the ground and VCC pins to the corresponding pins on the Pi, and the data pin to any digital pin.

Now, let's dive into the code. You can find the code for this project in my GitHub repository, which I'll link in the description. We'll be using a library to connect with the DHT22 sensor. There are two libraries you might come across: Adafruit Circuit Python DHT and Adafruit Python DHT. However, the latter is deprecated, so we'll focus on the former.

To install the library, follow the steps outlined in my companion write-up. It involves installing the Circuit Python library for Adafruit projects. If you're not familiar with Circuit Python, it's a microPython implementation by Adafruit Industries.

Now, let's take a look at the code. We have two Python files: `new_dht_simpletest.py` and `old_dht_simpletest.py`. The new file uses the Adafruit Circuit Python DHT library, while the old file uses the deprecated Adafruit Python DHT library.

Let's run the new file first. [Terminal output] As you can see, we're able to retrieve the temperature and humidity values. If you see a "pull buffer" message, just ignore it. It's a common error.

Now, let's try holding the sensor. [Terminal output] See how the humidity reading changes? That means the sensor is working correctly.

The code for the new file is quite simple. We import the necessary packages, create a DHT device object, and continually loop to read the temperature and humidity.

Now, let's try running the old file. [Terminal output] As you can see, it also retrieves the temperature and humidity values.

The code for the old file is similar, but it uses the deprecated library. We import the Adafruit_DHT library, define the sensor and pin, and use the `read_retry` method to retrieve the values.

[Sound of wrapping up]

That's it. I hope you learned something new today. Interfacing with a DHT22 sensor using your Raspberry Pi is quite straightforward. Happy exploring.
