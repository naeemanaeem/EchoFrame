Hello and welcome to this tutorial on interfacing a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with a Raspberry Pi. In this video, we're going to explore how to connect this sensor to the Raspberry Pi and read temperature and humidity values using Python.

The DHT11 is a popular digital temperature and humidity sensor. It's very simple, inexpensive, and suitable for various DIY projects. The sensor can measure temperature and humidity, making it perfect for weather stations, home automation, and more.

Let's take a closer look at the DHT11 sensor. It contains a negative temperature coefficient thermistor for measuring temperature and a resistive-type humidity sensor. The sensor provides digital output, making it easy to interface with microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi.

To interface the DHT11 with the Raspberry Pi, we'll use a Python library provided by Adafruit. First, we need to install the required library. We'll use GitHub to download the library, so make sure you have Git installed on your Raspberry Pi.

The installation involves a few command-line steps. First, clone the Adafruit Python DHT repository using `git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git`. Then, change directories to the cloned repository and install the required dependencies using `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl`. Finally, install the library using `sudo python setup.py install` or `sudo pip3 install Adafruit_Python_DHT`.

Now that we have the library installed, let's connect the DHT11 sensor to the Raspberry Pi. The sensor has four pins: VCC, DATA, NC, and GND. We'll connect VCC to 3.3V, DATA to GPIO pin 21, and GND to GND on the Raspberry Pi. Don't forget to add a 10k Ohm pull-up resistor between VCC and DATA.

With the connections in place, let's write some Python code to read temperature and humidity values. We'll use the Adafruit library to make it easy. The code will read the values and print them to the console.

Here's a simple test code to get you started. We'll use Thonny IDE to write and run the code. The code reads the temperature and humidity values using `Adafruit_DHT.read_retry`, checks if the readings are valid, and prints the values.

Let's run the code and see the output. We get a temperature reading of 28 degrees Celsius and humidity of 47%. 

But we don't want to just read the values once. We want to read them continuously. So, let's modify the code to run in an infinite loop. We'll also add a delay of one second between readings.

As we run the code, we can see the temperature and humidity values updating every second. To test the sensor's capabilities, let's use a soldering iron and a hot air gun to simulate temperature changes.

The sensor readings change as expected when we apply heat. We can see the temperature increase and humidity decrease. When we remove the heat source, the readings return to normal.

That's it for today's tutorial. We've successfully interfaced a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with a Raspberry Pi and read values using Python. Make sure to follow proper safety precautions when working with electronics and heat sources.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next tutorial.

üéôÔ∏è Episode based on data4.json:

Welcome to Donsky Tech. Today, we're going to explore how to interface with a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor using your Raspberry Pi. We'll be using Python as our programming language.

[Sound of electronics equipment in the background]

First, let's take a look at the hardware we'll be using. We have the DHT22 sensor module, a Raspberry Pi0W, a breakout board, and some connecting wires. The DHT22 module already has a pull-up resistor and filter capacitor, so we don't need to connect any external components.

The DHT22 module outputs temperature and humidity through a single data line, and it only has three pins: power, ground, and data. To connect it to our Raspberry Pi, we simply need to wire the ground and VCC pins to the corresponding pins on the Pi, and the data pin to any digital pin.

[Sound of fingers typing on a keyboard]

Now, let's dive into the code. You can find the code for this project in my GitHub repository, which I'll link in the description. We'll be using a library to connect with the DHT22 sensor. There are two libraries you might come across: Adafruit Circuit Python DHT and Adafruit Python DHT. However, the latter is deprecated, so we'll focus on the former.

[Sound of scrolling through a webpage]

To install the library, follow the steps outlined in my companion write-up. It involves installing the Circuit Python library for Adafruit projects. If you're not familiar with Circuit Python, it's a microPython implementation by Adafruit Industries.

[Sound of terminal output]

Now, let's take a look at the code. We have two Python files: `new_dht_simpletest.py` and `old_dht_simpletest.py`. The new file uses the Adafruit Circuit Python DHT library, while the old file uses the deprecated Adafruit Python DHT library.

Let's run the new file first. [Terminal output] As you can see, we're able to retrieve the temperature and humidity values. If you see a "pull buffer" message, just ignore it. It's a common error.

[Sound of fingers holding the sensor]

Now, let's try holding the sensor. [Terminal output] See how the humidity reading changes? That means the sensor is working correctly.

[Sound of fingers typing on a keyboard]

The code for the new file is quite simple. We import the necessary packages, create a DHT device object, and continually loop to read the temperature and humidity.

[Sound of terminal output]

Now, let's try running the old file. [Terminal output] As you can see, it also retrieves the temperature and humidity values.

[Sound of fingers typing on a keyboard]

The code for the old file is similar, but it uses the deprecated library. We import the Adafruit_DHT library, define the sensor and pin, and use the `read_retry` method to retrieve the values.

[Sound of wrapping up]

That's it. I hope you learned something new today. Interfacing with a DHT22 sensor using your Raspberry Pi is quite straightforward. Happy exploring.
