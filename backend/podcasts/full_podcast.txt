Welcome to this podcast episode, where we'll explore how to interface a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with a Raspberry Pi. I'm your host, and we'll dive into the world of sensors and microcontrollers.

The DHT11 is a popular digital temperature and humidity sensor that's widely used in DIY projects. It's a simple sensor that can directly interface with the Raspberry Pi, making it a great choice for beginners. The DHT11 provides two valuable pieces of information: temperature and humidity readings.

One of the reasons we chose the DHT11 is its simplicity and affordability. It operates on a wide range of power supplies, from 3 to 5 volts, and its maximum current requirement is only 2.5 milliampere during conversion. The sensor's accuracy is ¬±2¬∞C for temperature readings, which range from 0 to 50¬∞C, and ¬±5% for humidity readings between 20 to 80%.

To get started, we need to install the necessary library. We'll be using the Adafruit Python library, which can be easily downloaded from GitHub. The library provides a simple way to read data from the DHT11 sensor.

The DHT11 sensor has four pins: VCC, DATA, NC, and GND. We'll connect the VCC pin to the Raspberry Pi's 3.3V pin, the DATA pin to GPIO pin 21, and the GND pin to the Raspberry Pi's GND pin. Don't forget to add a 10 kiloohm pull-up resistor between the VCC and DATA pins.

Once we've connected the sensor and installed the library, we can start reading data. The Python code is straightforward: we define the sensor and pin, read the humidity and temperature using the `Adafruit_DHT.read_retry` function, and print the formatted temperature and humidity.

When we run the script, we get a single reading: "Temp=28.0*C Humidity=47.0%". But what if we want continuous readings? We can modify the code to run in an infinite loop, taking readings every second.

To test the sensor's capabilities, we'll use a soldering iron and a hot air gun. As we bring the soldering iron close to the sensor, the temperature reading increases. When we use the hot air gun, the temperature reading rises even higher.

Throughout this episode, we've explored how to interface a DHT11 sensor with a Raspberry Pi, install the necessary library, and read temperature and humidity data. We've also tested the sensor's capabilities using different heat sources.
