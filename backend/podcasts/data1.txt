Hello and welcome to this tutorial on interfacing a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with a Raspberry Pi. In this video, we're going to explore how to connect this sensor to the Raspberry Pi and read temperature and humidity values using Python.

The DHT11 is a popular digital temperature and humidity sensor. It's very simple, inexpensive, and suitable for various DIY projects. The sensor can measure temperature and humidity, making it perfect for weather stations, home automation, and more.

Let's take a closer look at the DHT11 sensor. It contains a negative temperature coefficient thermistor for measuring temperature and a resistive-type humidity sensor. The sensor provides digital output, making it easy to interface with microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi.

To interface the DHT11 with the Raspberry Pi, we'll use a Python library provided by Adafruit. First, we need to install the required library. We'll use GitHub to download the library, so make sure you have Git installed on your Raspberry Pi.

The installation involves a few command-line steps. First, clone the Adafruit Python DHT repository using `git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git`. Then, change directories to the cloned repository and install the required dependencies using `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-openssl`. Finally, install the library using `sudo python setup.py install` or `sudo pip3 install Adafruit_Python_DHT`.

Now that we have the library installed, let's connect the DHT11 sensor to the Raspberry Pi. The sensor has four pins: VCC, DATA, NC, and GND. We'll connect VCC to 3.3V, DATA to GPIO pin 21, and GND to GND on the Raspberry Pi. Don't forget to add a 10k Ohm pull-up resistor between VCC and DATA.

With the connections in place, let's write some Python code to read temperature and humidity values. We'll use the Adafruit library to make it easy. The code will read the values and print them to the console.

Here's a simple test code to get you started. We'll use Thonny IDE to write and run the code. The code reads the temperature and humidity values using `Adafruit_DHT.read_retry`, checks if the readings are valid, and prints the values.

Let's run the code and see the output. We get a temperature reading of 28 degrees Celsius and humidity of 47%. 

But we don't want to just read the values once. We want to read them continuously. So, let's modify the code to run in an infinite loop. We'll also add a delay of one second between readings.

As we run the code, we can see the temperature and humidity values updating every second. To test the sensor's capabilities, let's use a soldering iron and a hot air gun to simulate temperature changes.

The sensor readings change as expected when we apply heat. We can see the temperature increase and humidity decrease. When we remove the heat source, the readings return to normal.

That's it for today's tutorial. We've successfully interfaced a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with a Raspberry Pi and read values using Python. Make sure to follow proper safety precautions when working with electronics and heat sources.

Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
