Welcome to this tutorial on using the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with Raspberry Pi. 

The DHT11 is a simple digital sensor that can measure both temperature and humidity. 

It's a great choice for beginners because it's easy to use and inexpensive. 

The sensor works by detecting changes in resistance to measure temperature and humidity. 

It provides digital output, making it easy to interface with microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi.

The DHT11 operates on 3 to 5 volts and has a low current requirement. 

It can measure humidity between 20 to 80% with 5% accuracy and temperature from 0 to 50 degrees Celsius with 2 degrees accuracy.

To use the DHT11 with Raspberry Pi, you need to install a library. 

The library we'll use is from Adafruit, a well-known brand in the DIY electronics community.

First, we need to download the library from GitHub. 

Then, we install the required dependencies and build the library.

The library installation involves several commands. 

The first command downloads the library. 

The second command changes the directory. 

The third command installs the dependencies. 

The fourth command builds and installs the library.

After installing the library, we can write a simple Python program to read data from the DHT11. 

The program includes a declaration of the sensor and the pin it's connected to. 

It then reads the temperature and humidity using the library's read_retry function.

The program checks if the readings are valid and prints them. 

If the readings are not valid, it prints an error message.

To get continuous readings, we can modify the program to run in an infinite loop. 

We add a delay of one second between readings.

The program now continuously prints temperature and humidity readings.

Let's test the sensor with a heat source. 

We'll use a soldering iron and a hot air gun.

The temperature readings increase when we bring the heat source close to the sensor. 

The humidity readings decrease.

The DHT11 sensor provides accurate readings and is easy to use with Raspberry Pi.

Make sure to follow proper safety precautions when working with heat sources and electronics.

That's it for this tutorial. 

I hope you found it helpful. 

Thanks for watching.
