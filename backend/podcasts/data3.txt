Host: "Hey everyone, welcome back to Tech Pentagon! Today, we're going to build a weather station using Raspberry Pi Pico and the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. It's going to be a fun project, so let's get started!"

[Sound effect: A quick beep]

Host: "To make this project, we'll need a few components: an LCD display, some jumper wires, the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, a Raspberry Pi Pico, and a breadboard. Let's take a look at all of them."

[Sound effect: A gentle whoosh]

Host: "Now, let's see how to connect all these components. According to our circuit diagram, I've already built the connections. The Raspberry Pi Pico is connected to the DHT11 sensor and the LCD display via the breadboard and jumper wires."

[Sound effect: A quick zap]

Host: "Now, let's move on to the coding part. We'll need four files: dht.py, lcd_api.py, pico_i2c_lcd.py, and main.py. We'll be working on the main.py file. Here, we declare the I2C pins, the LCD display, and the DHT11 sensor."

Host: "We use the `time.sleep` function, clear the LCD, and read the temperature and humidity values from the sensor. I've explained this syntax in my previous video, so you can check that out if you're unsure."

[Sound effect: A quick beep]

Host: "Now, let's run the code and upload it to the Pico board. And... it's working! The temperature is showing as 33.2 degrees Celsius, and the humidity is 54.0 percent."

[Sound effect: A gentle whoosh]

Host: "But is it accurate? Let's check. According to Google, today's temperature in Howrah, West Bengal is 34 degrees Celsius. Our reading is 33.1 degrees Celsius, which is a difference of just 0.9 degrees. Not bad, right?"

[Sound effect: A gentle click]

Host: "So, there you have it! You can make a simple weather station using Raspberry Pi Pico and the DHT11 sensor. If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe for more upcoming videos. Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one!"
