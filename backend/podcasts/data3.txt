[Intro music fades out]

Host: "Hey everyone, welcome back to Tech Pentagon! Today, we're going to build a weather station using Raspberry Pi Pico and the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. I'll guide you through the process, and by the end of this episode, you'll have a working weather station. So, let's get started!"

[Sound of electronics equipment]

Host: "To make this project, we'll need a few components: an LCD display, some jumper wires, the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, Raspberry Pi Pico, and a breadboard. Let's take a look at the components."

[Visual description: components laid out on a striped surface]

Host: "Now, let's see how to connect them. Here's the circuit diagram. We'll use Fritzing to visualize the connections."

[Sound of software interface]

Host: "According to our circuit diagram, I've already built the connections. Now, let's move on to the coding part. We'll need four files: dht.py, lcd_api.py, pico_i2c_lcd.py, and main.py. We'll work on the main.py file."

[Sound of typing on a keyboard]

Host: "In the main.py file, I declared the I2C pins and the LCD display. Then, I defined the temperature 'T' and humidity 'H' variables using the DHT11 sensor. I also added some delay and cleared the LCD screen."

[Sound of coding]

Host: "Now, let's run the code and upload it to the Pico board."

[Sound of uploading code]

Host: "After uploading the code, you can see that my temperature is currently showing 33.2 degrees Celsius, and humidity is 54.0 percent. Let's check if it's accurate."

[Sound of smartphone interface]

Host: "I'll search for today's temperature in my location. According to Google, it's 34 degrees Celsius. Let's compare it with our reading: 33.1 degrees Celsius. Not bad, only a 0.9-degree difference!"

[Sound of satisfied tone]

Host: "So, there you have it! You can make a weather station using Raspberry Pi Pico and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe for more upcoming videos. Thanks for watching!"

[Outro music starts playing]

Host: "Thanks again, and I'll see you in the next episode!"
