So, we have to to work in the main.py files. First of all, I declared i2c equals to i2c and LCD equals to i2c LCD. These are basically the i2c pin and the LCD display. And then uh we have to declare that T equals to sensor.temperature, H equals to sensor.humidity and sensor we have to declare as DST 11 pin which we are using as a temperature and humidity sensor. Um then uh we have to use all the all these things, the time.sleep one, um LCD.clear, I already explained this syntax in the my previous video, you can go through the that video or I will give the link of the video in the description. You can watch from there."
